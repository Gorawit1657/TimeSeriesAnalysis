# Time Series Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing time series data, employing various statistical and machine learning methods for forecasting. Focuses on understanding and applying techniques commonly used in time series analysis.

The notebook demonstrates the following:
- Data preparation for time series analysis.
- Visualization of time-based patterns and trends.
- Application of forecasting models.

## Key Techniques

The project utilizes several key techniques for time series analysis:

- **Time Series Decomposition**: Separates the time series data into trend, seasonal, and residual components.
- **Moving Averages**: Averages over a rolling window to smooth the data.
- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**: A popular statistical model for forecasting based on historical data.
- **Exponential Smoothing**: A technique that applies exponentially decreasing weights to past observations.
- **Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series (STL)**: Decomposes time series data into seasonal and trend components using LOESS.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementing models like Random Forests, XGBoost, or other regressors to predict future values.
- **Model Evaluation**: Performance evaluation using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and others.

## Setup Instructions

To run the project, ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:

1. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels scikit-learn
    ```

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:

    - Open your terminal and navigate to the project folder.
    - Run the following command to launch the notebook:
      ```bash
      jupyter notebook TimeSeriesAnalysis.ipynb
      ```

3. **Prepare the Dataset**:

    - Ensure you have a time series dataset in a format such as CSV. Modify the data loading section to reflect the location of your dataset.

## Important Notes

- **Data Format**: Ensure the data contains a datetime index or a properly formatted time series column for analysis.
- **Model Selection**: The notebook provides examples of different models, but you may need to fine-tune them for optimal performance on your specific dataset.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Models such as ARIMA or machine learning models often require parameter tuning to achieve the best performance.
- **Visualization**: The notebook includes several visualization techniques to better understand the data trends, seasonality, and residuals.
- **Dependencies**: Ensure that all required libraries are installed before running the notebook. Missing dependencies can cause issues during execution.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement more advanced machine learning models such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for deep learning-based time series forecasting.
- Add more detailed hyperparameter tuning examples for models.
- Expand the dataset to cover a wider range of time series scenarios, such as multivariate time series.
