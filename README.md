# Time Series Analysis

## Objective

The objective  is to gain hands-on experience in applying various time series forecasting models. You will use the S&P 500 Closed price data to experiment with different models, evaluate their performance, and justify their use in financial engineering.

##Dataset

You will use the historical S&P 500 Closed price data. The dataset should include daily closing prices over several years to capture trends, seasonality, and other patterns.

## Key Techniques

The project utilizes several key techniques for time series analysis:

- **Time Series Decomposition**: Separates the time series data into trend, seasonal, and residual components.
- **Moving Averages**: Averages over a rolling window to smooth the data.
- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**: A popular statistical model for forecasting based on historical data.
- **Exponential Smoothing**: A technique that applies exponentially decreasing weights to past observations.
- **Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series (STL)**: Decomposes time series data into seasonal and trend components using LOESS.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementing models like Random Forests, XGBoost, or other regressors to predict future values.
- **Model Evaluation**: Performance evaluation using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and others.

## Important Notes

- **Data Format**: Ensure the data contains a datetime index or a properly formatted time series column for analysis.
- **Model Selection**: The notebook provides examples of different models, but you may need to fine-tune them for optimal performance on your specific dataset.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Models such as ARIMA or machine learning models often require parameter tuning to achieve the best performance.
- **Visualization**: The notebook includes several visualization techniques to better understand the data trends, seasonality, and residuals.
- **Dependencies**: Ensure that all required libraries are installed before running the notebook. Missing dependencies can cause issues during execution.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement more advanced machine learning models such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for deep learning-based time series forecasting.
- Add more detailed hyperparameter tuning examples for models.
- Expand the dataset to cover a wider range of time series scenarios, such as multivariate time series.
